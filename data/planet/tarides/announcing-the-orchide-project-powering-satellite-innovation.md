<p>It has been a few months since we announced our new product for both older and newer models of satellites: <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2023-07-31-ocaml-in-space-welcome-spaceos/">SpaceOS</a>. Since then, there have been exciting updates to the use of SpaceOS for innovative satellite applications.</p>
<p>Tarides is thrilled to announce our partnership with several esteemed organisations in the earth observation and space technology sector: <a href="https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en">Thales Alenia Space</a> France, <a href="https://upb.ro/">University Politechnica of Bucharest</a>, <a href="https://kplabs.space/">KpLabs</a>, and <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a> Romania. Under the banner of project ORCHIDE, part of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl4-2023-space-01-11">EU HORIZON CL4-2023-SPACE-01-11 programme</a>, Tarides and its spinout company <a href="https://parsimoni.co/">Parsimoni</a> will collaborate on high-performance secure-by-design software solutions tailored to the challenges of space.</p>
<h2>The Changing Landscape of Satellite Solutions</h2>
<p>New satellite technologies open up new use cases &ndash; making satellites accessible to a much wider audience.  The future of the market emphasises smaller, low-cost satellites, reducing the cost of services for end users. On-board data processing is also key as transferring large amounts of data from satellites is getting more and more challenging (for example due to radio wave limitations).</p>
<p>These modern satellites must also be reactive and dynamic, with reprogrammable designs that allow multiple users to share hardware and deploy their own applications, driving costs down. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space">More satellites have been launched into space in the last two years than ever before</a> enabling new (and lower cost) business use cases.</p>
<p>To support this increased demand, updated software solutions are required. Software in space needs to be secure as a remote hack could be catastrophic, and resource-efficient to maximise the use of limited energy and memory. This is where <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628">unikernel</a> technology, with its light-weight structure and security features, is a game changer.</p>
<p>Unikernels strip down the operating system to only the necessary components required by the application, resulting in smaller and more efficient applications tailored to specific use cases. For example <a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a>, an OCaml-based operating system that constructs unikernels, the smaller attack surface in combination with OCaml&rsquo;s <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2023-12-14-ocaml-memory-safety-and-beyond/">strong safety features</a> illustrates the cybersecurity benefits of unikernel technology.</p>
<h2>The Future is Bright</h2>
<p>The solutions resulting from the ORCHIDE project will enable the satellite industry to use edge computing resources with great flexibility whilst maintaining high levels of security. As a result, operators can scale production more efficiently, creating significant value for users of earth observation data.</p>
<p>ORCHIDE heralds a new era in satellite deployment, with lower barriers to entry, greater flexibility and security, and new opportunities for both operators and end users.</p>
