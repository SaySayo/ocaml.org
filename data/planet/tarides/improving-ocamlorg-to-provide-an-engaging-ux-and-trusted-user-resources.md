<p>The OCaml.org team, which includes members from Tarides, have been working hard to improve OCaml.org. In the first half of 2023, our primary focus was on the much-needed overhaul of OCaml.org's documentation and overall UX Design. We aspired to enhance user experience and accessibility throughout the year, with an eye on boosting accessibility as we progress. The transition to more semantic HTML was a crucial step in addressing the previously subpar accessibility. Simultaneously, we've been continuously working on revamping the Learn section, striving for a more streamlined and informative experience. The team's efforts also included ongoing UI enhancements and dark mode designs to align with modern preferences, which will be implemented shortly, promising a sleek and adaptable interface for users.</p>
<p>Users must be able to browse package documentation, learn and experiment with OCaml, and explore the vibrant community and extensive ecosystem surrounding OCaml. The website's revamp aims to align with these core objectives, ensuring that users effortlessly find, navigate, and gather essential information. By refining OCaml.org's UX and documentation, we aspire to bridge the gap between curiosity and comprehension, empowering users to delve into OCaml confidently, engage with its resources, and ultimately contribute to and thrive within its dynamic community.</p>
<p>While there's much to say about the updated documentation and reconstruction of the Learn section, we'll save that for another post. For this announcment, we'll focus on the design changes. Tarides UX/UI Designer, Claire Vandenberghe, led the aesthetic renovations outlined below.</p>
<h3>Modes for Accessibility</h3>
<p>Currently, the design phase is underway, and we've made partial strides toward implementing the light mode. However, our focus extends far beyond merely publishing updated landing pages. Our efforts also involve an extensive overhaul guided by <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> color contrast guidelines to guarantee improved accessibility. This includes creating a dark mode. This comprehensive approach demonstrates our commitment to not only refine the overall aesthetic of OCaml.org but also enhance inclusivity and user experience across the board.</p>
<p>Our primary focus has been completing three main landing pages, and they've been designed to provide both light and dark modes. They will be fully published soon, but here's a sneak peak of the improvements so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning: Discover our educational resources and opportunities to expand your knowledge.</li>
<li>Packages: Explore and find the perfect package for your needs.</li>
<li>Community: Connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to OCaml conversations through the dynamic <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/">Discuss</a> forums. You can also submit your blog's RSS feed to <a href="https://v2.ocaml.org/community/planet/">OCaml Planet</a>, a collection of OCaml-based blog posts.</li>
